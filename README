Goals:

0.1: one light source, diffuse reflections
     one box
     one untextured planar surface
     
0.2: one light source, diffuse and specular reflections
     one box
     one reflective sphere
     one textured planar surface

0.3: one light source, diffuse and specular reflections
     shadows
     one box
     one reflective sphere
     one textured planar surface
     (note: all required features)

EXTENSIONS:

0.4: cone, cylinder, tetrahedron, torus
0.5: additional light sources, perhaps coloured, including spotlight
0.6: moveable camera
0.7: refractions
0.8: bounding volumes to accelerate it
0.9: (adaptive) supersampling
0.10: textured sphere
0.11: 3d textures
0.12: fog
0.13: more advanced lighting model
